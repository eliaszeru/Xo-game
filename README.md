Got it! Here's a more casual and simple version that still reads cleanly for a GitHub README:

## XO Interactive Game

This is an XO (Tic Tac Toe) game we made at Powercoders as a group project, developed by me and my teammate Sediqa.

### How to Play

You need to use your **integrated terminal** to play this game.

It has two modes:
- **Single player** – play against the computer
- **Multiplayer** – play with a friend

To place your X or O, use numbers from **0 to 8**, like array indexes we learned in class.  
The board looks like this:

```
0 | 1 | 2
---------
3 | 4 | 5
---------
6 | 7 | 8
```
