This is the XO interactive game, that we made at Powercoders with my team mate Sediqa, as a group project blah blah, to play this game you have to use your integrated terminal. The game has 2 features. You can play it with the computer (single player) and also with your peer (multiplayer mode). When you want to spot X or O you need to play with the numbers starting from 0 until 8, like the concept of array index we have learnt in the class.
